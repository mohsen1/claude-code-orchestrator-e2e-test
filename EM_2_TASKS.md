# EM-2 Team Tasks

**Team**: worker-4
**Branch**: em-team-2
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-14

## Mission
Implement a TypeScript calculator CLI with core operations, expression parsing, and error handling.

## Overall Progress
- Status: In Progress
- Core implementation: Not started
- Testing: Not started
- Validation: Pending

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Core Implementation (worker-4)
- [ ] Implement operations.ts (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- [ ] Implement parser.ts (expression parsing)
- [ ] Implement calculator.ts (main logic)
- [ ] Implement index.ts (CLI entry point)
- [ ] Implement calculator.test.ts (unit tests)

### Phase 2: Validation (EM-2)
- [ ] Merge worker-4 branch locally
- [ ] Run build: `npm run build`
- [ ] Run tests: `npm run test`
- [ ] Test CLI manually
- [ ] Escalate to Director if stable

## Success Criteria
- All basic operations work correctly (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Tests pass
- Code compiles without errors
- Division by zero handled
- Invalid input handled gracefully

## Notes
- Using TypeScript with strict mode
- Using vitest for testing
- Supporting decimal numbers
- Output to stdout
