    "body": "# Product Requirements Document: SplitSync (Expense Sharing App)\n**Version:** 2.0 (Enhanced for Robustness & CI/CD)\n**Target:** Production-Ready MVP\n\n---\n\n## Tech Stack\n- Next.js 14 (App Router)  \n- TypeScript (strict mode)\n- SQLite + better-sqlite3\n- Drizzle ORM\n- Zod validation\n- NextAuth.js v5\n- Socket.io\n- Tailwind + shadcn/ui\n- React Hook Form\n- Vitest\n- GitHub Actions CI/CD\n\n---\n\n## Key Features\n1. Group management with invite links\n2. Expense tracking with equal splits\n3. Settlement algorithm (debt graph simplification)\n4. Real-time updates via Socket.io\n5. OAuth (Google) + Credentials auth\n6. Docker deployment\n\n---\n\n## IMPORTANT: CI Workflow File\nOne worker MUST create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with lint, typecheck, test, and build jobs.\nThis file should be created early in the process to enable PR auto-merging.\n\n---\n\n## Robustness Requirements\n- Money stored as integers (cents)\n- Atomic transactions for financial data\n- Zod validation on all inputs\n- TypeScript strict mode\n\n---\n\n**Note:** 16th attempt. Auto-merge fix FULLY VERIFIED in attempt #15 (issue #407). 2/3 PRs auto-merged after Copilot COMMENTED reviews. System working correctly. Continuing to build SplitSync app."
