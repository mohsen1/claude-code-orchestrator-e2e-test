    "title": "Build SplitSync (Expense Sharing App)",
    "body": "# Product Requirements Document: SplitSync (Expense Sharing App)\n**Version:** 2.0 (Enhanced for Robustness & CI/CD)\n**Target:** Production-Ready MVP\n**Deployment Strategy:** Dockerized Node.js Server (VPS/Railway/Fly.io) due to SQLite + Socket.io constraints.\n\n---\n\n## Tech Stack\n- Next.js 14 (App Router)\n- TypeScript (strict mode)\n- SQLite + better-sqlite3\n- Drizzle ORM\n- Zod validation\n- NextAuth.js v5\n- Socket.io\n- Tailwind + shadcn/ui\n- React Hook Form\n- Vitest\n- GitHub Actions CI/CD\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL: CI Workflow Requirement\n**MUST create** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:\n- Lint job (npm run lint)\n- Typecheck job (tsc --noEmit)\n- Test job (npm run test)\n- Build job (npm run build)\n\nThis CI workflow must be created FIRST before any other work, as PRs cannot merge without passing CI checks.\n\n---\n\n## Key Features\n1. Group management with invite links\n2. Expense tracking with equal splits\n3. Settlement algorithm (debt graph simplification)\n4. Real-time updates via Socket.io\n5. OAuth (Google) + Credentials auth\n6. Docker deployment with persistent volumes\n\n---\n\n## Robustness Requirements\n- All money stored as integers (cents)\n- Atomic transactions for financial data\n- Zod validation on all inputs\n- TypeScript strict mode (no `any` types)\n- CI/CD pipeline with lint, typecheck, tests, and build\n\n---\n\n**Note:** 15th attempt. Auto-merge fix VERIFIED (commit a615307). Copilot COMMENTED reviews auto-merge successfully. Previous attempts failed due to missing CI workflow. CI workflow MUST be created first."
